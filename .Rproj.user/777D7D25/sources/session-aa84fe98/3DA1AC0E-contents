## Notes for webscraping

**for webscraping:**

rvest if it works well for static site scrapping and also web browser control (with `read_html_live()`): <https://rvest.tidyverse.org/> dev. by wickham

Hayalbaz if you need more interaction : <https://github.com/rundel/hayalbaz>

A nice playlist on how to use rvest by data slice: <https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr5uaPu5L7xLEclrT0-2TWAz5FTkfdUiW&si=FWa02M1Qq7uLBMDB>

**to read pdf content:**

readtext (wrap pdftools and more): <https://github.com/quanteda/readtext>

pdftools: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pdftools/index.html>

Since other packages to extract tables from pdf have maintenance or dependency issues (with java) here is a tutorial using pdftools (a bit long): <https://crimebythenumbers.com/scrape-table.html>

For more complex sites, you might need to deal with JavaScript-rendered content. In such cases, `RSelenium` is a great tool. It allows you to automate a web browser, interact with dynamic content, and scrape data that isn’t readily available in the static HTML.

```{r}
#install.packages("rvest")
library(rvest)
library(httr)
```
