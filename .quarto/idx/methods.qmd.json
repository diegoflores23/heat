Interviews & Testimonies\n\nImplementation and enforcement of the indoor heat standard remains an ongoing process and understanding workers perceptions' of the standard throughout this process is an important question. Are workers aware of this heat standard? What do workers think about the process of implementation? Questions such as these are important to answer, hence, seven semi-structured interviews were carried out with workers from five different industries, namely warehousing & logistics, fast food & kitchen, cannabis, maintenance, and service (cafes). Furthermore, interviews with workers impacted by indoor heat allows Community Based Organizations (CBO's), decision makers, and other interested parties to hear and receive necessary feedback for more effective implementation and/ or enforcement.\n\nInterviews were carried out via video-call and in person over the span of a month. Many were set up by way of pre-existing relationships between CBO's and the primary partner organization, Southern California Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health (SoCalCOSH).\n\n#### Validity and reliability ![]()\n\nInterviews are an important part of gathering qualitative data and, outside of informally chatting with workers, were the only formal qualitative method use in this project. While interviews provide direct data about worker perceptions and opinions one cannot generalize interview findings to all workers in a particular industry. The views of workers are representative of their own. While often times qualitative methodologies are criticized for lacking generalizability, qualitative scholars highlight the misunderstanding that methods, such as qualitative interviews, lack any ability to extend generalizations[@smith2018]. Applying assumptions or findings to a broader audience is still possible, but not in the same way as quantitative results are typically generalized. **Provide example!! and write more on validity**\n\nThis set of qualitative interviews was intended to gather perspectives directly from workers over an attempt to vaguely understand the impact of the indoor heat standard through unfounded policy assumptions. As a result, the project carried out a relatively straightforward, reproducible interview recruitment process. As previously mentioned, workers were recruited by way of contacting pre-existing connections with employees working inside various CBO's throughout Los Angeles and the Inland Empire. Scheduling and interviews with workers typically occurred after being put in contact with them directly through an organizer representing their respective community based organization. In **X/7 cases** the community or regional organizer connected me directly with the organizer. This points to the crucial link that community and/ or regional organizers represent in connecting working class people to not only their respective community based organization but also to other institutional bodies and resources, such as, UCLA's Labor and Occupational Safety (LOSH) Program. **Include image of the network at play here.**\n\n#### Data sources\n\nThe recruitment process, while relatively straightforward, presents its own set of methodological questions. Namely what do the recruited interview subjects represent in the broader pool of potential interview subjects? Can one classify the recruited worker as an *'average worker'*? Are their views representative of the '*average worker'* ? Depending on who is being asked, the answer to these questions vary. For the purpose of this study workers have been classified into three categories: an active advocate/ organizer, newly involved worker, and a non-involved worker.\n\n#### Bias\n\nMost interview participants fall into the active advocate and newly involved worker category. It would be remiss to not discuss the potential bias this may represent in the study and interview conclusions. Specifically, some interview findings represent a particular perspective of workers who have been involved in labor advocacy and/ or organizing for years. From the interview findings these workers are more involved, analyze socio-economic systems critically, and encourage advocacy and activism. For example, one warehouse worker from Pomona, CA has been involved to varying capacities with a warehouse worker labor center for 10 years. The interview responses of this worker confirm that their perspective is noticeably different than that of a recent warehouse worker.\n\nDespite some of the bias present in the interview design the approach is justified when working with labor for the sake of building trust. Furthermore, in **some cases** the list of questions were not provided as a means of gauging whether or not this would really impact interview responses. While this is not a fool-proof method of comprehensively gauging bias, it provided sufficient evidence to the research team that the impact was negligible and worth the trade off in building trust while also increasing potential bias.\n\n#### Interview [protocol](https://hal.science/hal-03741838/document)\n\nUpong scheduling interviews with workers a verbal consent form and list of prospective questions were presented. The verbal consent form outlines expectations and guidelines from the interviewer and interviewee, **such as, the option to: remain anonymous, refuse any question, and to end the interview at any point**. Both are included in the appendix.\n\nProviding a list of questions prior to the interview may influence the response of participants which in turn may impact the overall bias of inferences. However, questions were provided in order to strengthen the trust and relationship between researcher and interviewee. Building trust between these two groups was crucial because when researching and interviewing labor, participants will have hesitations, doubts, or concerns that involving in this project may put their employment at risk. Apart from being common knowledge in organizing and occupational safety and health circles, scholars overwhelmingly recognize that fears of workplace retaliation present a major obstacle to any sort of labor advocacy and organizing[@hurd1998; @murphy].  \n\n## Quantitative\n\n### II.
