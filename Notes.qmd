**Figure Divs**

You can treat any markdown content you want as a figure by enclosing it in Pandoc div block with an identifier prefaced with #fig-. For example, here we create a figure that includes an embedded iframe:

::: {#fig-elephant}
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SNggmeilXDQ">

</iframe>

Elephant
:::

Note that the last paragraph in the div block is used as the figure caption.
