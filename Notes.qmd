# **Data Sources**

### **General (cont.)**

-   Emergency department encounters: various available but Pivot profiles includes all ED data files and inpatient discharge data file (for admissions originating in the emergency department) aggregated at the hospital level. number of visits, expected payer, discharge disposition, age groups, sex, preferred language spoken, race groups, principal diagnosis groups, and principal external cause of injury/morbidity groups. – find source link

-   CDC heat and Health Index ([HHI](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/Applications/heatTracker/)) this can be joined with labor occupation data from BLS or ACS to find the percentage of warehouse/ logistics workers and other industries that may be disproportionately impacted by indoor heat 

    -   “(HHI) incorporates historical temperature, heat-related illness, and community characteristics data at the ZIP code level” – need to add occupation to this data

-   [CDC Heat/ health tracke](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/Applications/heatTracker/)r: daily heat related illness: daily ED visits due to heat related illness per 100k – further disaggregated by sex and age– **we have the opportunity to disaggregate by occupation and race**

    -   Source: National Syndromic Surveillance Program ([NSSP](https://www.cdc.gov/nssp/index.html))

-   [US EPA Heat related workplace deaths](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/closer-look-heat-related-workplace-deaths#ref5): 2 categories construction and all other sectors 

    -   construction occupation comprised a large share of deaths relative to all other sectors 

    -   1992 -2022, “334 construction workers lost their lives to heat exposure on the job—meaning that the construction sector accounted for about 34 percent of all occupational heat-related deaths (see Figure 1).”

-   [Minnesota dept. Public health](https://data.web.health.state.mn.us/heat_ed): straight forward heat related emergency department (ED) visits 

    -   Typical example of the limits of analyzing heat: only go as far to dissagregate by sex and age

#### Data Source IV: webscraping OSHA establishment searches

**Methods Q:** webscrape search by industry, or do a broad establishment search? I think broad establishment search of all of So Cal or all of california? then subset by all these zip codes? Or start by zip code (one by one) that ultimately encompasses area of interest.

-   by region: Region 3 – Santa Ana Regional Office, Region 4 – Monrovia Regional Office

1.  Industry specific search: search by naics, all else is relatively the same

2.  The Establishments Search results page- will do establishment search

    Searching/ identifying material on any of these bases/ extractable things

-   Activity - Provides a unique identifier for the inspection. By clicking this link, specific information for this inspection will be displayed.

-   Opened - the date the inspection was started.

-   RID - Identifies the OSHA office or organizational unit responsible for the inspection.

-   St - Indicates the state postal abbreviation of the inspection site.

-   Type - Indicates the impetus for actually performing the inspection; e.g., may be part of a planned schedule, accident, complaint, etc.

-   Sc - Indicates whether a complete, partial or records only inspection was performed; may also indicate no inspection if for some reason the inspection could not take place.

-   SIC - Indicates the 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification Code from the 1987 version SIC manual which most closely applies. By clicking on this link, the SIC description is displayed.

-   Vio - Indicates the number of OSHA standards which were cited.

-   Establishment Name - Identifies the establishment that was inspected.

Searches may be sorted by Date, Name, Office, or State. Searches are sorted by date in descending order by default. Clicking on Date will sort on the date in ascending order. Clicking the check box next to the search result and clicking the Get Detail button will display the inspection details for each inspection. If more than 20 results are returned, click on the arrow next to the Result Page text to navigate to the other search results. To return to the search page to perform another search, click on the Return to Search link.

-   

-   urpose: quarterly count of employment and wages by county, MSA, state, etc, by AREA and **NAICS (industry)**. 

-   **CALCULATIONS:**

    -   \% change in employment: (Growth) (warehouse/ logistics, carwash, fast food/ service)

    -   Warehouse: all other sectors ratio 

    -    county level, zoom into city level e.g.: SB county, San bernardino city, Vernon, Commerce… 

-   Annual vs quarterly? Whats the difference? Not sure 

**EPA**: Regarding [A Closer Look: Heat-Related Workplace Deaths](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/closer-look-heat-related-workplace-deaths#ref7)

-    “Data for this feature were provided by BLS. The data in Figure 1 are publicly available on the BLS Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities website at: [www.bls.gov/iif/home.htm](http://www.bls.gov/iif/home.htm). Data for the outdoor workers map figure came from BLS’s Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages: [www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm](http://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm).”

**QCEW data structure(cont.)**

-   QCEW CSV files sliced by industry, area, and establishment size-class. 

    -   industry slice: all  records associated w/ the industry for a single time period. 

    -   area slice: all the records associated w/ the area for a single time period. 

    -   size slice: all records published w/ in a specific size class for the 1st Q of specified year.

-   QCEW: can I find NAICS carwash/ warehouses – probably available, the feature from the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/closer-look-heat-related-workplace-deaths#ref5) uses data from here to map the density of outdoor workers by county

**Concretizing / Data Viz ideas**

-   Mapping heat/ temperatures and carwash/ warehouse density in a given zipcode, merge CDC heat and health index (see above). maybe just need average temperatures instead of an heat and health index

-   Common identifier: zipcode, NAICS, geospaital point? Coordinate? 

#### **Data source II: Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities [database](https://www.bls.gov/iif/data.htm)**

-   Source: Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) gathered by BLS is available at <https://www.bls.gov/iif/data.htm> 

    -   Article Source: Acloser look– [EPA Heat related workplace deaths ](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/closer-look-heat-related-workplace-deaths#ref7)

-   Source: **Occupational Injuries and Illnesses by industry data available there\^**

#### **Data Source III**

-   Possible source for location of warehouses see bookmarks bar, rocket mortgage

## Literature Review

[**Calmatters** 4/24 Waiting and sweltering: Why are California’s indoor heat protections for workers five years late?]{.underline}

-   2005 outdoor heat standard passsed first of its kind in the country, \>80 = water+ shade, \<95 = additional breaks + monitoring. "a 2021 study \[IZA\] suggested it has helped to decrease workplace injuries on hot days." outlining the importance of indoor heat standard and mentioning citations

-   IZA institute on the study of labor found that these policies have a significant reduction in workplace injuries (find claim).

-   Amazon citation mentioned in article calosha [complaints](https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/KSBD-CalOSHA-Heat-Citations-01-31-24.pdf) from amazon fulfiment center 2535 e 3rd st san bernardino , subsequent agree/ disagree

[**Jisung park,** IZA, Temperature, Workplace Safety, and Labor Market Inequality]{.underline}

-   "Hotter temperature increases workplace injuries significantly, causing approximately 20,000 injuries per year. The effects persist in both outdoor and indoor settings (e.g. manufacturing, warehousing), and for injury types ostensibly unrelated to temperature (e.g. falling from heights), consistent with cognitive or cost-related channels." (1)

[**Hauptman.** The Health and Safety of Incarcerated Workers: OSHA’s Applicability in the Prison Context]{.underline}

-   "This article documents how current occupational health and safety regulations and enforcement mechanisms fail to protect incarcerated workers, who are especially vulnerable to both unsafe working condi- tions and arbitrary retaliation" (73)

-   provides history of prison labor, history of OSHA and their enforcment mechanisms, part 3 the term "employee" as applied to prisoners and the consistent prisoner exemption of fed protective legislation

[**Behrer et al.** Heat has larger impacts on labor in poorer areas]{.underline}

-   alternatively their 1 sentence summary reads "Wealth moderates the negative income effects of heat." a kind of vice versa, meaning wealth differences/ inequality mitigate the (negative) impact of heat on labor productivity, labor income, and work hours. This suggests those with wealth suffer less income losses, specifically payroll income, due to the ability of wealth to absorb the negative impacts of heat.

## General tips

**Citations and references workflow**

-   Follow hands on Data Viz's workflow: [Zotero and Better BibTeX for Notes and Biblio](https://handsondataviz.org/zotero.html)

[**Mapping using tigris**]{.underline} – mapping chapter in [Mastering Software Dev in R](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/mapping.html)

-   Awesome ability to pull state county & tracts from US census, loaded as a spatial object **see** [walker data](https://walker-data.com/census-r/census-geographic-data-and-applications-in-r.html)**bookdown on tigris, examples below**

-   see further documentation from Walker [here](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016-2/walker.pdf) - great maps on average income by zip code

-   I shoudl create an interactive map such as this title [sac.map](https://crd230.github.io/lab3.html) leaflet with median income chloropleth and the sac metro area shapefile

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
    library(sp)
    library(ggplot2)
    denver_tracts <- tracts(state = "CO", county = 31, cb = TRUE, 
                            class = "sf")
    plot(denver_tracts)

    ca_county <- counties("CA")
    plot(ca_county$geometry)


    lac <- tracts("CA", "los angeles county")
    ggplot(lac) +
      geom_sf() + theme_classic()
```

### Article Layout chapter ([quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html#available-columns)) very useful

-   specifically [columns specifiers](https://quartoand.me/page-layout)

**Creating multi-column [layouts](https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/11/multicolumn)/ Combining mulitple plots into one**

-   patchwork or cowplot to combine multilpe ggplot2 lots

-   Custom css

-   grid arrange may work really well too see google doc notes on image lit review

**page layout:** qmd [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/page-layout.html#grid-customization) is very helpful here.

-   see [quartoandme](https://quartoand.me/page-layout) page layout article

-   default qmd is article format, centered at middle for readability (600px - 900px wide) for landing or index pages consider using other layouts. Examples below of divs and column layout

how to wrap text around a figure github answer [here](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/11053)

-   essentially you can do it in divs and set the div to float and include text in another div that is under it

```{r setup2, eval = FALSE}
fomrat: 
html:
page-layout: article, full, custom (use the css grid system)
```

[quarto tips and tricks](https://www.productive-r-workflow.com/quarto-tricks#toc) - has a ton of good tips, footnotes, iframe, tabs, etc

[quarto bookdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html) - quarto documentation

-   under HTML theming: once theme is chosen, can customize the theme presets such as font family (serif, georgia etc), base font size, background color, linestretch (distance between lines of text, defaults to 1.5)

[rmd bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html)

{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "45"} knitr::include_graphics(c("images/socalcoshlogo.jpg", "images/uclalosh.png")) \#![](images/socalcoshlogo.jpg){fig-align="left" width="233"}

**Figure Divs**

You can treat any markdown content you want as a figure by enclosing it in Pandoc div block with an identifier prefaced with #fig-. For example, here we create a figure that includes an embedded iframe:

::: {#fig-elephant}
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SNggmeilXDQ">

</iframe>

Elephant
:::

Note that the last paragraph in the div block is used as the figure caption.

Note on Images:

well the only way I was able to get the images side by side was by the current

[Making your Rmd fancy:](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/rmd-fancy.html) Adding a big image to the front of the page with the title also present is called a hero image

**Bookdown books**

[hands on data visualization](https://handsondataviz.org/organization.html) - Jack dougherty - **not an R book**

-   all about data viz and commmunicating social sci data effectively

-   geospatial data

-   chart.js/ highchart good templates

-   also geospatial is his book [On The Line](https://ontheline.trincoll.edu)

**Area notes:** 06037 Los Angeles County,

California 06059 Orange County,

California 06071 San Bernardino County, California

Operating warehousing and storage facilities and providing related logistics services--are classified in Industry Group 4931, Warehousing and Storage.

### **CODEBOOK notes**

own_code - 3 = public ownersip

annual_avg_estabs = Annual average of quarterly establishment counts for a given year

total_annual_wages = Sum of the four quarterly total wage levels for a given year

annual_contributions = Sum of the four quarterly contribution totals for a given year

annual_avg_wkly_wage = Avg weekly wage based on 12-monthly employment levels and annual wage levels.

avg_annual_pay = Average annual pay

location quotient: over the year change

#### **Current Population Survey**

CPS counts employed people, whereas the QCEW program counts covered.

[**QCEW 2024 Q1 data available**](https://www.bls.gov/cew/)

DATA: retrieving by area/county then subsetting by NAICS/inudstry

## heat and occupation NOTES

```{r 2023_load_indsutry_data, eval = FALSE}
ffood <- qcewGetIndustryData("2023", "a", "722513")
lac_ff <- ffood %>% 
  rename(fips = area_fips) %>% 
  filter(fips == "06037") 
  
carwash <- qcewGetIndustryData("2023", "a", "811192")
lac_carwash <- carwash %>% 
  rename(fips = area_fips) %>% 
  filter(fips == "811192")
```

```{r industry_function, eval= FALSE}
qcewGetIndustryData <- function (year, qtr, industry) {
	url <- "http://data.bls.gov/cew/data/api/YEAR/QTR/industry/INDUSTRY.csv"
	url <- sub("YEAR", year, url, ignore.case=FALSE)
	url <- sub("QTR", tolower(qtr), url, ignore.case=FALSE)
	url <- sub("INDUSTRY", industry, url, ignore.case=FALSE)
	read.csv(url, header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote="\"", dec=".", na.strings=" ", skip=0)
}
```

ran into issues in bind row merge some NA's that are fine but parse out the rows rthat have 0 taxable qtrly wages etc, no industry value in lac_naics24 -- Issue solved!

```{r summary_tools_descriptive_stats, eval = FALSE}
#str(industries24)
industries24 %>% 
  select(-c(fips, naics)) %>% 
  dfSummary(
    graph.col = TRUE, style = "grid", 
    graph.magnif = 0.75
  ) %>% stview()
```
