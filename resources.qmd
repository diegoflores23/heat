This explanation of the indoor heat standard comes directly from CALOSHA's heat resource website [99Calor found here](https://www.99calor.org/Indoor-Heat.html).

### **When does your boss need to do something about high temperatures?** *At 87°F or 82°F!*

The chart below describes when an employer must take action to lower workplace temperatures that hit 87°F or 82°F if you are wearing "heat restrictive clothing" or working near a "high radiant heat source." These terms are defined below.

Definitions 

*"Heat restrictive clothing"*

:   Full body clothing that reduces your ability to cool off. Examples: waterproof/ insulated coveralls, welding jackets, hazard protection suits.

*"Radiant heat"*

:   Heat transmitted by electromagnetic waves and not by conduction or convection. In other words, radiant heat includes the sun, hot objects (e.g. large machinery), hot liquids (e.g. kitchen oils), hot surfaces (e.g. heat lamps, grills, ovens), and fire.

*"Radiant heat source"*

:   Any object, surface, or other source of radiant heat that, if not shielded, would raise the globe temperature of the cool-down area 5°F or more than the temperature of the cool-down area.

*"High radiant heat area"* 

:   A work area where an the temperature is *at least 5°F greater than the immediate temperature* in the broader work area.

*"Heat protective clothing"*

:   Equipment/ clothing made to protect against heat illness. Examples: water-cooled garments, air-cooled garments, cooling vests, wetted over-garments, heat-reflective clothing.

## How to identify heat stress and illness?

**Heat illness is serious and can worsen rapidly. If you feel any of these symptoms you have the right to take a preventative cool down break at any point until you feel healthy enough to return to work.**

## Are you experiencing high temperatures at work? 

### **See Step-By-Step Guide to Filing a Heat Related Complaint Online with Federal OSHA.**

If you have been exposed to unfair work conditions related to extreme indoor temperatures you have the opportunity to hold your employer accountable. Below is a link to the step by step guide to file a heat related OSHA complaint provided by the [National Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health](https://nationalcosh.org/heat-climate-justice#tools) (National COSH).
